If it is a Script Mod (has a *.ts4script inside the ZIP File): Copy the *.package File & *.ts4script File into your Sims 4 Mods Folder (not more than one Subfolder deep for example Documents > Electronic Arts > The Sims 4 > Mods > ScriptMods). Don’t rename any of those or it might not work. Enable Script Mods/CC via Game Options > Other Ingame. If there are more than one Version of a Mod available make sure to only install one Version (package) File.
